Take a string from the user that consists of the '+' symbol. Process the string such that the final string does not include the '+' symbol and the immediate left non-'+' symbol. Select and choose the optimal ADT. Implement the program by including the appropriate header file.

Eg: 
Input: 45fgd+++ab+c
Output: 45ac

What is the time complexity of each solution, and what ADT, and data structure will you use? What is the optimal solution? Justify your answer
